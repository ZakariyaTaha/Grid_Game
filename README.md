<h3>ENIGMA</h3>

Enigma is composed of 4 levels:<br><br>
<h4>Level 1</h4>
--> Entry through door 1, nothing special inside.
<h4>Level 2</h4>
--> Entry through door 2, almost similar to level 1 except for an added apple which can be retrieved with the L key.
<h4>Level 3</h4>
--> Enter through door 3, little riddle proposed in the statement, you just have to walk on the pressure buttons (black dot) and take the key to be able to return to the LevelSelector, otherwise you can light the animated torch, activate the levers left and right or walk on the pressure plate to remove rocks from right and left.
<h4>Enigma</h4>
<h5>--> Part1 </h5>
You have to enter the 4th door, you will notice that throughout Enigma, the instructions are given in the form of Dialog. At first you will have to use the potion to make the ghost of a dead man appear. You will then have to walk on the buttons forming a sigma to free the passage of the first rock, and on the pressure plate to free the second passage (5sc to pass). The second message from the ghost appears, you must then activate the lever to open the door which will teleport to the place where the sword is located. Once the sword is in hand, the monsters appear, you will have to kill the one in front of the door with the L key, then take it to return to the labyrinth. Then it will be necessary to recover the shield which will be to the left and go towards the boss by killing all the monsters on the way in the same way as the first. Finally you kill the master, you collect the key and you go through the door which opens, then the door of the barn to go to the second phase.
<br>
Ps: note that without the sword and the shield you can still access the boss, but the person dies (disappears) and you can no longer continue the game: a kind of game over.
<br>
<h5>--> Part 2</h4>
Once again everything is indicated according to the instructions (sometimes you will have to be on the arrival square of a door to see the Dialog). You will first have to recover the helmet and the bow, otherwise the character will die facing the boss as explained previously, then we go to the door in front of the barn, which leads to a level. This level contains an apple and a "secret" passage that leads directly next to the boss to surprise him, then he is eliminated and the child is saved, the game ends and a message appears.
